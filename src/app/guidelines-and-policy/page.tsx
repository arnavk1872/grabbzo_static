        We welcome your opinions and appreciate your feedback on the services
        being provided to you. Your reviews, photos, profile, and comments are
        all subject to Content Guidelines. If the review, photo, or profile is
        found to be objectionable or fails to follow the guidelines, we reserve
        the right to take action as we deem necessary. This may include deleting
        or altering your reviews or comments, photographs uploaded, restricting
        your review activity, or deleting your Grabbzo account altogether, with
        or without notice.

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Content Quality & Length:</strong> Reviews should be at
            least 100 characters for the services provided and the experiences
            at the restaurant by using our services. It would be appreciated if
            the review is detailed and covers all the major aspects, as the same
            would act as feedback to us. It would be appreciated if there is no
            use of unparliamentary language and the review follows the
            guidelines, so that the review is not required to be removed by us.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Relevance:</strong> Reviews should be specific to the
            restaurant and based on personal experiences. Avoid spamming or
            irrelevant content. In case a review is removed by us and a similar
            review is uploaded for the same restaurant, that review might be
            removed without notice.

        <li>
          <p>

          <p className="mt-2">
            Acts that constitute as 'Solicitation' include: Explicit/Implied

          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            If there are reports and evidence of solicitation, the review will
            be removed, and your Grabbzo account may also be deleted without any

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>No Bullying or Blackmail:</strong> Reviews cannot be used to
            threaten restaurants or extort benefits. Any such acts are condemned
            and in case it is found that you have misused your position, the

        Guidelines for Restaurants
      </h3>

        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Keep Listings Updated:</strong> Ensure your restaurant's
            details, such as hours and location, are accurate. Notify us if your
            restaurant cannot accept orders.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>No Review Solicitation:</strong> Restaurants should never
            offer incentives for reviews or attempt to manipulate ratings.
            Violations may result in review removal and further actions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Respond to Criticism Constructively:</strong> Address
            negative feedback professionally without offering incentives to
            change reviews. Work on resolving deficiencies mentioned in
            feedback.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Avoid Conflicts of Interest:</strong> Restaurant employees,
            owners, or affiliates must not write reviews for their own
            establishments.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Don’t Entertain:</strong> In case a customer raised any
            demand or asks for benefits at the threat of bad reviews or ratings,
            the same shall not be tolerated. Further, inviting users who have
            reviewed and given a low rating back to the restaurant for a
            complimentary meal, invites false negative reviews. Such conduct on
            part of the restaurant shall be avoided and the restaurant shall not
            entertain any such threats from customers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Accountability for Actions:</strong> Illegal activity or
            poor behavior, such as serving underage patrons, must be addressed
            by the restaurant and should not involve Grabbzo.
